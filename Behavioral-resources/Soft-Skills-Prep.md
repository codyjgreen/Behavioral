# Interview Techniques - STAR Method

#### Situation

  Identify situational examples which convey your experience in your role.
  
  Example: In this role we are looking for a person who likes to triage and drive events to resolution. Can you tell me about a recent example where you have done this?
#### Tasks
 Identify your role in a given situation or job.

Example: What were your responsibilities?

What were your objectives?

What were your tasks?
#### Actions
 Show the interviewer the actions you took to solve a problem or deliver results.

Avoid answers with "we" as you want to show what you did for your team or company.

What initiatives did you take?

#### Result

 It's important to show the interviewer that you are able to deliver results. Example: What was the final outcome? What was accomplished?
