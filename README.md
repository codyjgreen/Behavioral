# Behavioral Interviewing

While the technical interview is what most of your focus will be on in your job search you shouldn't skimp on keeping your behavioral interviewing skills sharp.

You want to make sure that you are the person who is going to stand out to them culturally and going to be the best fit for their individual team.

I've gathered some information and materials for you to make preparing for these as pain free as can be.

## Activity

First look at the [Soft Skills Prep Doc](https://github.com/codyjgreen/Behavioral/blob/master/Behavioral-resources/Soft-Skills-Prep.md) and familiarize yourself with the S.T.A.R method and think about how you would answer the questions in that document using it.

What i'd like you to do next is look up at least two companies that you would like to work for.


Write down and familiarize yourself with their values, mission, CEO, product, any conversational information that you find interesting.

You will bring this for the mock interviews and the person interviewing you will be able to pick one of your companies to interview you as.

You dont have to memorize everything about the company just lookup enough to be able to talk about them.

Take a look at my [Flatiron Prep Doc](https://github.com/codyjgreen/Behavioral/blob/master/Behavioral-resources/Example-Company-Research.md) that I used when I interviewed here for an example.

Next look at the [Questions To Ask Doc](https://github.com/codyjgreen/Behavioral/blob/master/Behavioral-resources/Questions-To-Ask.md) and pick at least three questions that you like so that when the interview is winding down and the interviewer asks you if you have any questions for them you have something to ask.

All of this is in preparation for our pair mock interview exercise where you will match up with each other and one of you will be the interviewer who gets to pick an interviewee's company and run through a full 15 minute interview and give feedback.

After that you will switch roles and do the same thing.
After 30 minutes you will be getting a new partner and doing it all again implementing the feedback you got before.

After it is all said and done you will have interviewed twice and been interviewed twice. You should have some actionable feedback for things you could work on.
